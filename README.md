# QOSF_Task

This repository contains Task 1 and Task 4 of QOSF Mentorship Program Screening Tasks. 

Only circuit depth of 88 is achieved in task 4 whereas depth under 50 is required. Hence I have also did Task 1.

After this, I tried Task 4 from sratch and found a optimal circuit with depth of 24, which is given in `Task-4-reduced_depth.ipynb`. Also executed the circuit on IBM Quantum Hardware to compare simulator results with real-world performance of this circuit.
